# AGENT_STATUS

## Overview

The `AGENT_STATUS` file is a simple, standardized format for AI agents to communicate their status to the development environment and optionally after a task is completed. This allows terminals, IDEs, editors, and other tools to display relevant information about AI agents working in a project.

It's meant to be simple, agent/tool-agnostic and file-based so it can be versioned, read by any tool or script on the system, or with the current terminal or editor.

If desired, the file can be checked in with completed work for later review, parsing metrics or tags as part of CI pipeline. 

### Example Uses
- AGENT_STATUS can be read by a terminal and shown within its tabs for developers managing multiple local agents in multiple tabs/windows
- For human interaction it can be piped into a chat window for quickly gaining context to an agent's current question or request for approval
- Can be checked in at the end of work to summarize the task, how many tokens were spent and give overall status
- Shell scripts could reference the file as it changes or periodically to post to an external service

## File Location

The `AGENT_STATUS` file should be placed in the root of the project or specific directory where an AI agent is operating. Tools should look for this file in the current working directory or parent directories.

## File Format

The file uses a simple `KEY=VALUE` format, with one key-value pair per line:

```
AGENT_NAME=Code Refactor Assistant
AGENT_TYPE=Claude-3.5-Sonnet
STATUS=working
STATUS_TEXT=Analyzing class dependencies
STATUS_COLOR=#3498db
PROGRESS=45
```

Comments can be added using the `#` character:

```
# This agent is working on the authentication module
AGENT_NAME=Auth Helper
```

## Tool Integration Examples

### Terminal Emulators (like Ghostty)

Terminals can enhance tab displays with agent information:
- Show status color in tab indicator
- Display agent emoji and name in tab title
- Show progress and status in tab details

### Code Editors/IDEs

IDEs can integrate agent status in various ways:
- Status bar integration showing current agent activities
- Sidebar panels for agent interactions
- Color coding of files being actively edited by agents
- Integration with notifications for completed tasks

### Git Clients

Git tools can incorporate agent information:
- Show which branches have active agents
- Indicate which files are being modified
- Display agent activity in commit history views

### Status Bar Applications

Standalone status monitors can:
- Show overall agent activity across projects
- Provide quick toggles for agent interaction
- Display estimated completion times

### Project Management Tools

Task trackers can leverage agent data:
- Track agent progress on assigned tasks
- Calculate time/cost savings from agent usage
- Show agent activity history

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Reading the file**: Applications should read the file periodically (e.g., every 0.5-2 seconds) or monitor the modification timestamp and check for modifications before parsing.

2. **File changes**: Agents should update the file atomically to avoid partial reads.

3. **Missing values**: Applications should handle missing keys gracefully and use reasonable defaults.

4. **Unknown keys**: Applications should ignore keys they don't recognize for forward compatibility.

5. **Security**: The file should only contain non-sensitive information. No credentials or private data.
